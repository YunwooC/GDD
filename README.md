# Growing Degrees Day Simulator

Growing Degree Days (GDD) is a measure of heat accumulation used in agriculture to estimate plant and animal development rates such as the date that a flower will bloom, an insect will emerge from dormancy, or a crop will reach maturity.
We will use Python and the meteostat API to get historical weather data, calculate and plot GDD averages over a given time period, calculate plot accumulated GDD since a given date, and explore other data trends of interest to the students.
We can use Tkinter for the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or we could work on a web-app type of interface.
