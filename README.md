# Growing Degrees Day Simulator

Growing Degree Days (GDD) is a measure of heat accumulation used in agriculture to estimate plant and animal development rates such as the date that a flower will bloom, an insect will emerge from dormancy, or a crop will reach maturity.

Historical weather data was pulled from Python Meteostat API to calculate and plot GDD averages over a given time period using Pandas and MatPlotLib library.
